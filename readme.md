# Automatic-Hand-Sanitizer-Machine-using-Arduino-for-Level-Detection
This repository contains the code for arduino nano which was used for level detection
An automatic hand sanitizer dispenser is a device dispensing a controlled 
amount of sanitizer. They are often used in conjunction 
with automatic faucets in public restrooms. They help conserve the amount 
of sanitizer used and stem infectious disease transmission
Our initial point of contact with germs is often from the hands. 
Unfortunately, not many people wash or maintain basic hygiene of their 
hands. Over the time people have started emphasizing more and more on 
maintaining personal cleanliness and hygiene. And the best way to keep 
viruses and bacteria at bay is, of course, by frequent hand washing. 
Using a sanitizer dispenser for this reduces your chances of getting sick 
in your inevitable daily interactions with people and germs. Hand 
sanitizer dispenser also is handy in water-scarce areas.
The Ultrasonic sensors of the automatic hand sanitizer dispenser detect the 
Ultrasonic energy that is Obstructed by the hand. When hands are placed in 
the proximity of the sensor, the ultrasonic energy quickly fluctuates. This 
fluctuation triggers the pump to activate and dispense the designated amount 
of sanitizer.
This module is based on contact less. We can hang this machine to the wall 
this will work on electricity we need a adapter to work this machine.
An automatic hand sanitizer system was designed, which will be presented in 
two stages describing the instrument structure and control parts. This work 
focused on using the elasticity of pumps and improving people’s access to 
devices.
We have designed an automatic hand sanitizer system that is compatible 
with various containers. When one moves one’s hand close to the device 
sensor, the hand sanitizer container is pumped once.
The automatic hand sanitizer device proposed in this paper is ultimately 
expected to contribute to contactless hand disinfection in public places and 
virus infection prevention. Additionally, it is economical and eco-friendly by 
decreasing waste emissions.
